    <h2> nice and tasty cupcakes</h2>
    <p>I came up with this maple cupcake recipe a couple of years ago. They taste great and are not too sweet!</p>
    <h3>ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup maple syrup </li>
        <li>5 tablespoons margarine</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>2 ¼ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 12-cup muffin tins.</li>
        <li>Beat maple syrup and margarine together in a large bowl until well mixed and creamy. Mix in egg until combined.</li>
        <li>Combine all-purpose and whole wheat flours, baking powder, nutmeg, salt, and ginger in a small bowl. Add dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in batches, alternating with the milk, beating batter briefly after each addition. Fill the prepared muffin cups 3/4 full with batter.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the centers comes out clean, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
